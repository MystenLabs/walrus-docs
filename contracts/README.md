# Walrus Testnet Move contracts

This is the Move source code for the current Walrus Testnet instance, which are deployed on Sui
Testnet. The latest version information can be found at the bottom of the
[`walrus/Move.lock`](./walrus/Move.lock) file.

**A word of caution:** Walrus Mainnet will use new Move packages with struct layouts and function
signatures that may not be compatible with this package. Move code that builds against this package
will need to adapted.
