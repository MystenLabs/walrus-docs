/// High level overview of the staking pool:

/// To track the users' portion of the pool, we associate shares to the
/// staked WAL. Initially, the share price is 1 WAL per share.
/// When a new stake is added to the pool, the total number of shares
/// increases by an amount that corresponds to the share price at that
/// time. E.g., if the share price is 2 WAL per share, and 10 WAL are
/// added to the pool, the total number of shares is increased by 5
/// shares. The total number of shares is stored in 'num_shares'.
///
/// As stakes are added/withdrawn only in the granularity of epochs, we
/// maintain a share price per epoch in 'exchange_rates'.
/// StakedWal objects only need to store the epoch when they are created,
/// and the amount of WAL they locked. Whenever a settlement is performed
/// for a StakedWal, we calculate the number of shares that correspond to
/// the amount of WAL that was locked using the exchange rate at the time
