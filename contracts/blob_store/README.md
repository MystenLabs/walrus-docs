This is the Move source code for the Walrus devnet instance. We provide this so developers can experiment with building Walrus apps that require Move extensions. This code is published on Sui testnet at package ID `0x8bf57168d5acb0e83efa49905a326d0d624ff147955106d94fb09b6abdaa7bbc`.

A word of caution: Walrus testnet will use new Move packages with struct layouts and function signatures that may not be compatible with this package. Move code that builds against this package will need to rewritten.
