# Walrus Devnet Move contracts

This is the Move source code for the Walrus Devnet instance. We provide this so developers can
experiment with building Walrus apps that require Move extensions. This code is published on Sui
Testnet at package ID `0x7e12d67a52106ddd5f26c6ff4fe740ba5dea7cfc138d5b1d33863ba9098aa6fe`.

**A word of caution:** Walrus Testnet will use new Move packages with struct layouts and function
signatures that may not be compatible with this package. Move code that builds against this package
will need to rewritten.
