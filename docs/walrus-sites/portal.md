# The Walrus Sites portal

We use the term "portal" to indicate any technology that is used to access and browse Walrus Sites.
As mentioned in the [overview](./overview.md#the-site-rendering-path), we foresee three kinds of
portals:

1. server-side portals;
1. custom local apps; and
1. service-worker based portals in the browser.

Currently, only a server-side portal is served at <https://walrus.site>.

```admonish note title="Hosting of the service worker"
In the past, the service-worker based portal was hosted at <https://walrus.site> and the
server-portal at <https://blob.store>. This is no longer the case.

The service-worker portal is no longer hosted, but you can still run it locally. Its code is
available in the `walrus-sites` repository. For more information, see
[running the portal locally](#running-the-portal-locally).

The old domain, `blob.store` is currently an alias for `walrus.site` but will be removed in the
future.
```

```admonish danger title="Walrus Sites stable branch"
The stable branch of Walrus Sites is `testnet`.
```

## Running the portal locally

You can run a portal locally if you want to browse Walrus Sites without accessing
external portals or for development purposes.

This requires having the [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) tool installed. To start, clone the
`walrus-sites` repo and enter the `portal` directory.

Make sure you are on the stable branch:

``` sh
git checkout testnet
```

``` sh
cd portal
pnpm install
# Build the portal you want to use, or both
pnpm build:server
pnpm build:worker

```

to install the dependencies, and then either one of the following commands:

``` sh
# Serve the server-side portal
pnpm serve:dev:server

# Serve the service-worker portal
pnpm serve:dev:worker
```

to serve one of the portals. Typically, you will find it served at `localhost:8080` (but check the
output of the serve command).

For the production versions, use the `prod` commands: `serve:prod:server` and `serve:prod:worker`.

## Configuring the portal

The most important configuration parameters for the portal are in `portal/common/lib/constants.ts`:

- `NETWORK`: The Sui network to be used for fetching the Walrus Sites objects. Currently, we
  use Sui `testnet`.
- `AGGREGATOR`: The URL of the [aggregator](../usage/web-api.md) from which the portal will
  fetch the Walrus blobs.
- `SITE_PACKAGE`: The Sui object ID of the Walrus Sites package.
- `MAX_REDIRECT_DEPTH`: The number of [redirects](./redirects.md) the portal will follow
  before stopping.
- `SITE_NAMES`: Hard coded `name: objectID` mappings, to override the SuiNS names. For development
  only.
