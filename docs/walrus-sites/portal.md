# The Walrus Sites Portal

We use the term "Portal" to indicate any technology that is used to access an browse Walrus Sites.
As mentioned in the [overview](./overview.md#the-site-rendering-path), we foresee three kinds of
Portals:

1. Server-side Portals;
1. custom local apps; and
1. service-worker based Portals in the browser.

Currently, only the service-worker based Portal is available.

## Running the Portal locally

You can run a service worker Portal locally:

- To browse Walrus Sites without accessing external Portals; or
- for development purposes.

This requires having the [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) tool installed. To start, clone the
`walrus-sites` repo and enter the `portal` directory. Here, run:

``` sh
pnpm install
```

to install the dependencies, and

``` sh
pnpm serve
```

to serve the Portal. Typically, you will find it served at `localhost:8080` (but check the output of
the serve command).

## Configuring the Portal

The most important configuration parameters for the Portal are in `constants.ts`.

- `NETWORK`: The Sui network to be used for fetching the Walrus Sites objects. Currently, we
  use Sui `testnet`.
- `AGGREGATOR`: The URL of the [aggregator](../usage/web-api.md) from which the service worker will
  fetch the Walrus blobs.
- `SITE_PACKAGE`: "0x514cf7ce2df33b9e2ca69e75bc9645ef38aca67b6f2852992a34e35e9f907f58"
- `MAX_REDIRECT_DEPTH`: The number of [redirects](./redirects.md) the service worker will follow
  before stopping.
- `SITE_NAMES`: Hard coded `name: objectID` mappings, to override the SuiNS names. For development
  only.
