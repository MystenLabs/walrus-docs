Last Updated: June 18, 2024

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) govern your use of certain software services, including Walrus
Sites provided by Mysten Labs, Inc. (“**Mysten Labs**”) (collectively the "**Services**"). By
accessing the Services, you agree to and accept these terms and conditions. If you don’t agree to be
bound by these Terms, do not use the Services.

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S. CUSTOMERS: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE
AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND MYSTEN LABS THROUGH
BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION XIV “DISPUTE
RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.

## I. Privacy Policy

Please review our [Privacy Policy](../legal/privacy.md), which also governs your use of the
Services, for information on how we collect, use and share your information. By using the Services
you agree to be bound by our Privacy Policy.

## II. Eligibility

You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract
with Mysten Labs, and not otherwise barred from using the Services under applicable law, including
applicable U.S. and non-U.S. export control and trade sanctions laws.

## III. Walrus Sites

The Services allow you access website resources (“**Stored Objects**”) that are stored in the Walrus
Store and linked by the Sui blockchain. In providing the Services, Mysten Labs provides you with a
means to access the Stored Objects, but Mysten Labs does not process the Stored Objects
directly. Mysten Labs has no responsibility to screen or moderate Stored Objects accessible via the
Services. Stored Objects are developed by people over whom Mysten Labs exercises no control. The
Services may provide you with access to Stored Objects that some people find objectionable,
inappropriate, or offensive. We assume no responsibility for the content of Stored Objects accessed
through the Services.

## IV. Service Conditions and Disclaimers

1. <u>Fees</u>. We may charge fees for some or part of the Services we make available to you. We
   reserve the right to change those fees at any time, in our sole and absolute discretion.
1. <u>Acknowledgment of Certain Risks; Disclaimers</u>. Mysten Labs disclaims any and all
   responsibility or liability for the accuracy, content, completeness, legality, reliability, or
   operability or availability of information or material accessed via the Services. Mysten Labs
   disclaims any responsibility for the deletion, failure to store, misdelivery, or untimely
   delivery of any information or material. Mysten Labs disclaims any responsibility for any harm
   resulting from accessing any information or material on any blockchain through the Services. YOU
   UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU DOWNLOAD OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIAL OR DATA THROUGH THE USE OF
   THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
   DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS IN THE DOWNLOAD OF SUCH MATERIAL OR
   DATA.

   The Services could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which
   could impede or limit the ability of Mysten Labs to continue to make its proprietary software,
   and thus, could impede or limit your ability to continue to use the Services.

   You understand that the Walrus Store and Sui blockchain (and all other networks with which the
   Services may be compatible) remain under development, which creates technological and security
   risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and
   transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Sui blockchain is
   variable and may increase at any time, thereby impacting any activities taking place on the Sui
   blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased prices for using the Services.

   The Services are provided to you "as-is" and "with all faults." We make no warranties or
   representations regarding the functionality, quality, or fitness for a particular purpose of the
   Services. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

   1. Mysten Labs disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but
      not limited to any warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a
      particular purpose.
   1. Mysten Labs does not guarantee that the Services will be free from errors, bugs, or
      interruptions in service, including failed transactions for which you have paid associated gas
      fees. Any use of the Services is at your own risk.
   1. Mysten Labs shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or
      consequential damages, whether arising from the use of the Services or any inability to use
      the Services, even if Mysten Labs has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   1. It is your responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness, and usefulness of any
      information, content, or data provided by the Services.
   1. Mysten Labs is under no obligation to provide support, maintenance, updates, or fixes for the
      Services.
   1. Mysten Labs is not obligated to correct or address any errors, defects, or issues identified
      in the Services.
   1. Mysten Labs may change, update, or discontinue the Services at any time without notice.

## XIII. Governing Law and Forum Choice.

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal
arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws
provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section XVII “Dispute Resolution,” the
exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Mysten Labs are not required to
arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the County of Santa Clara, and you and
Mysten Labs each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

## XIV. Dispute Resolution

1. <u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</u>. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy
  arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation
  or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely
  by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or
  proceeding. You and Mysten Labs agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the
  interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Mysten Labs are each waiving the
  right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall
  survive termination of these Terms.
1. <u>Exceptions</u>. As limited exceptions to Section XVII(A) above: (i) we both may seek to
  resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek
  injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or
  misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
1. <u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</u>. The arbitration will be conducted by the
  American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”)
  then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or
  by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand
  for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA
  provides a form Demand for Arbitration at [<u>www.adr.org</u>](http://www.adr.org). Any
  arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both
  agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive
  authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and
  scope of this arbitration agreement.
1. <u>Arbitration Costs</u>. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
  governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we
  are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in
  arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from
  you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and
  expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
1. <u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</u>. Except as provided in Section XIV(B) above, the
  arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either
  party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
  relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
  claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is,
  injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that
  threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be
  litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree
  that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of
  the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
1. <u>Class Action Waiver</u>. YOU AND MYSTEN LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
  OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
  PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through
  arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may
  not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific
  provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall
  be null and void.
1. <u>Severability</u>. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section XVII(F) of these
  Terms (“**Class Action Waiver**”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides
  that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will
  still apply.

## XV. General Terms

1. <u>Reservation of Rights</u>. Mysten Labs and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and
  interest in and to the Services, including all associated intellectual property rights. You
  acknowledge that the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United
  States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark,
  service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.
1. <u>Entire Agreement</u>. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and
  agreement between Mysten Labs and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and
  replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Mysten Labs and you
  regarding the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an
  arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum
  extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and
  effect. Except where provided by applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or
  transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Mysten Labs’ prior written
  consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory
  right, without such consent, will be null. Mysten Labs may freely assign or transfer these Terms
  without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of
  the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
1. <u>Notices</u>. Any notices or other communications provided by Mysten Labs under these Terms
  will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the
  date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
1. <u>Waiver of Rights</u>. Mysten Labs’ failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
  will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or
  provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
  Mysten Labs. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of
  its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms
  or otherwise.
