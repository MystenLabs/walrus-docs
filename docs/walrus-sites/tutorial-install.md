# Installing the site builder

This section describes the steps necessary to setup the Walrus Sites' `site-builder` tool and
prepare your environment for development.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you

- have a recent version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed;
- followed all [Walrus setup instructions](../usage/setup.md).

Then, follow these additional setup steps.

## Installation

Similar to the `walrus` client CLI tool, we currently provide the `site-builder` client binary for
macOS (Intel and Apple CPUs), Ubuntu, and Windows:

| OS      | CPU                   | Architecture |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ubuntu  | Intel 64bit           | [`ubuntu-x86_64`](https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/site-builder-testnet-latest-ubuntu-x86_64)                |
| Ubuntu  | Intel 64bit (generic) | [`ubuntu-x86_64-generic`](https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/site-builder-testnet-latest-ubuntu-x86_64-generic)|
| MacOS   | Apple Silicon         | [`macos-arm64`](https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/site-builder-testnet-latest-macos-arm64)                    |
| MacOS   | Intel 64bit           | [`macos-x86_64`](https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/site-builder-testnet-latest-macos-x86_64)                  |
| Windows | Intel 64bit           | [`windows-x86_64.exe`](https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/site-builder-testnet-latest-windows-x86_64.exe)      |

```admonish title="Windows"
We now offer a pre-built binary also for Windows. However, most of the remaining instructions assume
a UNIX-based system for the directory structure, commands, etc. If you use Windows, you may need to
adapt most of those.
```

You can download the latest build from our Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket (correctly setting the
`$SYSTEM` variable):

``` sh
SYSTEM= # set this to your system: ubuntu-x86_64, ubuntu-x86_64-generic, macos-x86_64, macos-arm64, windows-x86_64.exe
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/mysten-walrus-binaries/site-builder-testnet-latest-$SYSTEM -o site-builder
chmod +x site-builder
```

To be able to run it simply as `site-builder`, move the binary to any directory included in your
`$PATH` environment variable. Standard locations are `/usr/local/bin/`, `$HOME/bin/`, or
`$HOME/.local/bin/`.

```admonish note
The site builder will look for the default configuration file `sites-config.yaml` in the current
directory, the `$XDG_HOME/walrus/sites-config.yaml` and `$HOME/walrus/sites-config.yaml` directory.
In case you want to use explicitly a different `sites-config.yaml`, use the `--config` flag to
specify the path to the configuration file.
```

Once this is done, you should be able to simply type `site-builder` in your terminal.

```terminal
$ site-builder
Usage: site-builder [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  publish  Publish a new site on Sui
  update   Update an existing site
  convert  Convert an object ID in hex format to the equivalent Base36
               format
  sitemap  Show the pages composing the Walrus site at the given object ID
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

  â‹®
```

## Configuration

The `site-builder` tool needs a configuration file to work. This file is called `sites-config.yaml`
and looks like this:

```yaml
# module: site
# portal: walrus.site
package: 0xdf9033cac39b7a9b9f76fb6896c9fc5283ba730d6976a2b1d85ad1e6036c3272
# general:
#   rpc_url: https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
#   wallet: /path/to/.sui/sui_config/client.yaml
#   walrus_binary: /path/to/walrus
#   walrus_config: /path/to/devnet_deployment/client_config.yaml
#   gas_budget: 500000000
```

As you can see, the configuration file is quite simple. The only mandatory field is the `package`
field, which represents the Sui object ID of the Walrus Sites smart contract. You can find the
latest version of the package in the [Walrus Sites
repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites/tree/testnet) on the `testnet` branch.

```admonish danger title="Walrus Sites stable branch"
The stable branch of Walrus Sites is `testnet`.
Make sure that you always pull the latest changes from there.
```

You can define the location of the `sites-config.yaml` file using the `--config` flag when running
the `site-builder` commands like so:

``` sh
site-builder --config /path/to/sites-config.yaml publish <build-directory-of-a-site>
```

However, if are not a fan of repeating the same flags over and over, it's always easier to have the
configuration file in one of the [default locations](./tutorial-install.html#admonition-note).

Download the `sites-config.yaml` file from the repository, and place it in one of the aforementioned
default locations. To illustrate, we will use the `~/.config/walrus` directory, like so:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites/refs/heads/testnet/sites-config.yaml -o ~/.config/walrus/sites-config.yaml
```

You are now ready to start working on your Walrus Sites! ðŸŽ‰
