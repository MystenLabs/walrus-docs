# Installing the site builder

We describe here the steps necessary to setup the Walrus Sites' `site-builder` tool, and prepare
your environment for development.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you:

- have a recent version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed;
- have `git` installed; and
- followed all [Walrus setup instructions](../usage/setup.md).

Then, follow these additional setup steps.

## Clone the repository and build the `site-builder` tool

First clone and enter the Walrus Sites repo from <https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-sites>.

``` sh

cd walrus-sites
```

Then, build the release version of the site builder:

``` sh
cargo build --release
```
