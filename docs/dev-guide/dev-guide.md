# Developer guide

This guide introduces all the concepts needed to build applications that use Walrus as a storage
or availability layer. The [overview](../design/overview.md) provides more background and explains
in more detail how Walrus operates internally.

This developer guide describes the following:

- [Components](components.md) of Walrus of interest to developers that wish to use it for
  storage or availability.
- [Operations](dev-operations.md) supported through client binaries, APIs, or Sui operations.
- [The Sui structures](sui-struct.md) Walrus uses to store metadata, and how they can be read
  from Sui smart contracts, or through the Sui SDK.

Refer again to the [glossary](../glossary.md) of terms as a reference.

```admonish danger title="Disclaimer about the Walrus Testnet"
The current Testnet release of Walrus and Walrus Sites is a preview intended to showcase
the technology and solicit feedback from builders, users, and storage-node operators.
All transactions are executed on the Sui Testnet and use Testnet WAL and SUI which have no
value. The state of the store **can and will be wiped** at any point and possibly with no warning.
Do not rely on this Testnet for any production purposes, it comes with no availability or
persistence guarantees.

Furthermore, encodings and blob IDs may be incompatible with the future Testnet and Mainnet, and
developers will be responsible for migrating any Testnet applications and data to Mainnet. Detailed
migration guides will be provided when Mainnet becomes available.

Also see the [Testnet terms of service](../legal/testnet_tos.md) under which this Testnet is made
available.
