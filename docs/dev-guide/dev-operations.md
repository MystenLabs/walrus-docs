# Operations

## Blob encoding and blob ID

Walrus stores blobs across storage nodes in an [encoded form](../design/encoding.md), and refers
to blobs by their *blob ID*. The blob ID is deterministically derived from the content of a blob
and the Walrus configuration. The blob ID of two files with the same content will be the same.

You can derive the blob ID of a file locally using the command: `walrus blob-id <file path>`.

## Store

Walrus may be used to **store a blob**, via the native client APIs or a publisher.

```admonish danger title="Public access"
**All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by all.** Therefore you must not use Walrus
to store anything that contains secrets or private data without additional measures to protect
confidentiality.
```

Under the hood a number of operations happen both on Sui as well as on storage nodes:

- The client or publisher encodes the blob and derives a *blob ID* that identifies the blob. This
  is a `u256` often encoded as a URL-safe base64 string.
- A transaction is executed on Sui to purchase some storage from the system object, and then to
  *register the blob ID* occupying this storage. Client APIs return the *Sui blob object ID*. The
  transactions use SUI to purchase storage and pay for gas.
- Encoded slivers of the blob are distributed to all storage nodes. They each sign a receipt.
- Signed receipts are aggregated and submitted to the Sui blob object to *certify the blob*.
  Certifying a blob emits a Sui event with the blob ID and the period of availability.

A blob is considered available on Walrus once the corresponding Sui blob object has been
certified in the final step. The steps involved in a store operation can be executed by the binary
client, or a publisher that accepts and publishes blobs via HTTP.

Walrus currently allows the storage of blobs up to a maximum size that may be determined
through the [`walrus info`](../usage/client-cli.md#walrus-system-information) CLI command. The
maximum blob size is currently 13.3&nbsp;GiB. You may store larger blobs by splitting them into
smaller chunks.

Blobs are stored for a certain number of *epochs*, as specified at the time they were stored. Walrus
storage nodes ensure that within these epochs a read succeeds. The current Testnet uses a short
epoch duration of one day for testing purposes, but Mainnet epochs are likely to be longer such as
many weeks each.

## Read

Walrus can also be used to **read a blob** after it is stored by providing its blob ID.
A read is executed by performing the following steps:

- The system object on Sui is read to determine the Walrus storage node committee.
- A number of storage nodes are queried for blob metadata and the slivers they store.
- The blob is reconstructed from the recovered slivers and checked against the blob ID.

The steps involved in the read operation are performed by the binary client, or the aggregator
service that exposes an HTTP interface to read blobs. Reads are extremely resilient and will succeed
in recovering the blob in all cases even if up to one-third of storage nodes are unavailable. In
most cases, after synchronization is complete, blob can be read even if two-thirds of storage nodes
are down.

## Certify Availability

Walrus can be used to **certify the availability of a blob** using Sui. Checking that this happened
may currently be done in 3 different ways:

- A Sui SDK read can be
  used to authenticate the certified blob event emitted when the blob ID was certified on Sui. The
  client `walrus blob-status` command may be used to identify the event ID that needs to be checked.
- A Sui SDK read may be
  used to authenticate the Sui blob object corresponding to the blob ID, and check it is certified,
  before the expiry epoch, and not deletable.
- A Sui smart contract can read the blob object on Sui (or a reference to it) to check
  it is certified, before the expiry epoch, and not deletable.

The underlying protocol of the
[Sui light client](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-light-client)
returns digitally signed evidence for emitted events
or objects, and can be used by off-line or non-interactive applications as a proof of availability
for the blob ID for a certain number of epochs.

Once a blob is certified, Walrus will ensure that sufficient slivers will always be
available on storage nodes to recover it within the specified epochs.

## Delete

Stored blobs can be optionally set as deletable by the user that creates them. This metadata is
stored in the Sui blob object, and whether a blob is deletable or not is included in certified blob
events. A deletable blob may be deleted by the owner of the blob object, to reclaim and re-use
the storage resource associated with it.

If no other copies of the blob exist in Walrus, deleting a blob will eventually make it
unrecoverable using read commands. However, if other copies of the blob exist on Walrus, a delete
command will reclaim storage space for the user that invoked it, but will not make the blob
unavailable until all other copies have been deleted or expire.
