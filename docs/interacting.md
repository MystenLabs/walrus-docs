# Interacting with Walrus

We provide 3 ways to interact directly with the Walrus storage system:

- Through the walrus [client command line interface (CLI)](client-cli.md).
- Through a [JSON API](json-api.md) of the walrus CLI.
- Through an [HTTP API](web-api.md) exposed by the walrus client daemon.
