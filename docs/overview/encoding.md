# Encoding, overheads and verification

The following list summarizes the basic encoding and cryptographic techniques used in Walrus:

- **Storage nodes** hold one or many **shards** in a storage epoch out of a larger total (1000, for
  instance). Each shard contains one blob **sliver** for each blob past point of availability. Each
  shard is assigned to a storage node in a storage epoch.

- An [erasure code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_codes) **encode algorithm** takes a blob
  and encodes it as K symbols, such that any fraction p of symbols can be used to reconstruct
  the blob. Each blob sliver contains a fixed number of such symbols.

- Walrus selects p < 1/3 so that a third of symbols and slivers can be used to reconstruct the blob
  by the **decode algorithm**. The matrix used to produce the erasure code is fixed and is the same
  for all blobs in the Walrus system, and encoders have no discretion about it.

- Storage nodes manage one or more shards, and corresponding slivers of each blob are distributed
  to all the storage shards.

  As a result, the overhead of the distributed store is ~5x that of the blob itself, no matter how
  many shards there are. The encoding is systematic, meaning that some storage nodes hold part of
  the original blob, allowing for fast random access reads.

Each blob is also associated with some metadata including a blob ID to allow verification:

- A **blob ID** is computed as an authenticator of the set of all shard data and metadata (byte
  size, encoding, blob hash).

  Walrus hashes a sliver representation in each of the shards and adds the resulting
  hashes into a Merkle tree. Then the root of the Merkle tree is the blob hash used to derive the
  blob ID that identifies the blob in the system.

- Each storage node can use the blob ID to check if some shard data belongs to a blob using the
  authenticated structure corresponding to the blob hash (Merkle tree). A successful check means
  that the data is indeed as intended by the writer of the blob (who might be corrupt).

- When any party reconstructs a blob ID from shard slivers, or accepts any blob claiming
  to be a specific blob ID, it must check that it encodes to the correct blob ID.

  This process involves re-coding the blob using the erasure correction code, and deriving the
  blob ID again to check that the blob matches. This prevents a malformed blob (incorrectly
  erasure coded) from ever being read as a valid blob at any correct recipient.

- A set of slivers equal to the reconstruction threshold belonging to a blob ID that are either
  inconsistent or lead to the reconstruction of a different ID represent an incorrect encoding
  (this happens only if the user that encoded the blob was malicious and encoded it incorrectly).

  Walrus can extract one symbol per sliver to form an inconsistency proof.
  Storage nodes can delete slivers belonging to inconsistently encoded blobs,
  and upon request return either the inconsistency proof or an inconsistency certificate posted
  on chain.
