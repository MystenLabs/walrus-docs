## SCOPE

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by Mysten
Labs, including on our websites (the "**Site**"), and other online and
offline offerings. The Site, our services and our other online and
offline offerings are collectively called the "**Services**." For
clarity, the Services do not include the Walrus Protocol or any other
decentralized aspect of the Walrus or Sui Blockchain that is not
controlled by Mysten Labs due to the decentralized nature of these
blockchains.

## CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole
discretion. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we
will notify you as required by applicable law. You understand and agree
that you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Privacy Policy if
you continue to use our Services after the new Privacy Policy takes
effect.

## PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT

The categories of personal information we collect depend on how you
interact with us, our Services and the requirements of applicable law.
We collect information that you provide to us, information we obtain
automatically when you use our Services, and information from other
sources such as third-party services and organizations, as described
below.

A.  **Information You Provide to Us Directly**

We may collect the following personal information that you provide to
us.

- **Account Creation**. We may collect information if you create an
  account with us, such as your name, username, email address, or
  password.

  transactions on the Services, you may need to provide us or our
  third-party payment processors with access to or information about
  your digital wallet. We will never ask you for or collect your

  details associated with your activities on our Services, including
  to deliver you your rewards associated with your use of the
  Services.
- **Your Communications with Us**. We may collect personal
  information, such as email address when you request information
  about our Services, register for our newsletter or marketing
  promotions, request customer or technical support, apply for a job
  or otherwise communicate with us.
- **Interactive Features**. We and others who use our Services may
  collect personal information that you submit or make available
  through our interactive features (e.g., via the Mysten Labs

  media pages). Any personal information you provide on the public
  sections of these features will be considered "public," unless
  otherwise required by applicable law, and is not subject to the

B.  **Information Collected Automatically**

We may collect personal information automatically when you use our
Services:

  automatically when you use our Services, such as your Internet
  protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie
  identifiers, mobile carrier, mobile advertising and other unique
  identifiers, browser or device information, location information
  (including approximate location derived from IP address), Internet
  service provider, and metadata about the content you provide. We may
  also automatically collect information regarding your use of our
  Services, such as pages that you visit before, during and after
  using our Services, information about the links you click, the types
  of content you interact with, the frequency and duration of your
  activities, and other information about how you use our Services.
- **Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Other Technologies**. We, as
  well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other
  functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local
  storage, and other technologies ("**Technologies**") to
  automatically collect information through your use of our Services.
- **Cookies**. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers
  that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience.
- **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons**. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon)
  is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects
  information about engagement on our Services. The use of a pixel tag
  allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a
  particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may
  also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages
  have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.

> Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general
> categories:

  you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are
  required to identify irregular website behavior, prevent fraudulent
  activity, improve security, or allow you to make use of our
  functionality;

  performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic
  practices to help us understand how individuals use our Services

  offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our
  Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our
  Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests,

  third-party Technologies to deliver content, including ads relevant
  to your interests, on our Services or on third-party websites.

> *See "[Your Privacy Choices and
> Rights](#your-privacy-choices-and-rights)" below to understand your
> choices regarding these Technologies.*

- **Analytics**. We may use our Technologies and other third-party
  tools to process analytics information on our Services. These
  technologies allow us to process usage data to better understand how
  our website and web-related Services are used, and to continually
  improve and personalize our Services. Some of our analytics partners

  privacy policy of the company providing it.

C. **Information Collected from Other Sources**

  other sources, including through third-party services and
  organizations. For example, if you access our Services through a

B.  **Administrative Purposes**

We use your information for our legitimate interest, such as:

- Pursuing our legitimate interests such as direct marketing, research

C.  **Marketing and Advertising our Products and Services**

We may use personal information to tailor and provide you with content
and advertisements. We may provide you with these materials as permitted
by applicable law. Some of the ways we may market to you include email
campaigns, custom audiences advertising, and "interest-based" or
"personalized advertising," including through cross-device tracking.

If you have any questions about our marketing practices or if you would
like to opt out of the use of your personal information for marketing
purposes, you may contact us at any time as set forth in "[Contact
Us](#contact-us)" below.

D.  **With Your Consent**

We may use personal information for other purposes that are clearly
disclosed to you at the time you provide personal information or with
your consent.

E.  **Other Purposes**

We also use your information for other purposes as requested by you or
as permitted by applicable law.

- **Automated Decision Making**. We may engage in automated decision
  making, including profiling. Mysten Labs's processing of your
  personal information will not result in a decision based solely on
  automated processing that significantly affects you unless such a
  decision is necessary as part of a contract we have with you, we
  have your consent, or we are permitted by law to engage in such
  automated decision making. If you have questions about our automated
  decision making, you may contact us as set forth in "[Contact
  Us](#contact-us)" below.
- **De-identified and Aggregated Information.** We may use personal
  information and other information about you to create de-identified
  and/or aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic
  information, de-identified location information, information about
  the device from which you access our Services, or other analyses we
  create.

## HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION

We disclose your information to third parties for a variety of business
purposes, including to provide our Services, to protect us or others, or
in the event of a major business transaction such as a merger, sale, or
asset transfer, as described below.

A.  **Disclosures to Provide our Services**

The categories of third parties with whom we may share your information
are described below.

- **Notice Regarding Use of Blockchain.** Transactions on the Services
  will be conducted via Blockchain. Information about your transfers
  will be provided to a Blockchain and may be accessible to third
  parties due to the public nature of the Blockchain. Because entries
  to a Blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be
  possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous,
  public wallet address using external sources of information, any
  transaction you enter onto the Blockchain could possibly be used to
  identify you, or information about you.
- **Other Users of the Services and Parties You Transact With.** Some
  of your personal information may be visible to other users of the
  Services (e.g., information featured on generally accessible parts
  of your profile; usernames of other Mysten Labs Services users). In
  addition, to complete transfers via the Services, we will need to
  share some of your personal information with the party that you are
  transacting with.
- **Third Party Websites and Applications.** You may choose to share
  personal information or interact with third-party websites and/or
  third-party applications, including, but not limited to, third-party
  electronic wallet extensions. Once your personal information has
  been shared with a third-party website or a third-party application,
  it will also be subject to such third party's privacy policy. We
  encourage you to closely read each third-party website or
  third-party application privacy policy before sharing your personal
  information or otherwise interacting with them. Please note that we
  do not control, and we are not responsible for the third-party
  website's or the third-party application's processing of your
  personal information.
- **Service Providers**. We may share your personal information with
  our third-party service providers who use that information to help
  us provide our Services. This includes service providers that
  provide us with IT support, hosting, customer service, and related
  services.
- **Business Partners**. We may share your personal information with
  business partners to provide you with a product or service you have
  requested. We may also share your personal information to business
  partners with whom we jointly offer products or services.
- **Affiliates**. We may share your personal information with members
  of our corporate family.
- **Other Users/Website Visitors**. As described above in "[Personal
  Information We
  Collect](#personal-information-we-collect)," our
  Services allow you to share your profile and/or User Content with
  other users or publicly, including to those who do not use our
  Services.
- **Advertising Partners**. We may share your personal information
  with third-party advertising partners. These third-party advertising
  partners may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our
  Services to collect information regarding your activities and your
  device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited,
  location, time of day). These advertising partners may use this
  information (and similar information collected from other services)
  for purposes of delivering personalized advertisements to you when
  you visit digital properties within their networks. This practice is
  commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or
  "personalized advertising."
- **APIs/SDKs**. We may use third-party application program interfaces
  ("**APIs**") and software development kits ("**SDKs**") as part of
  the functionality of our Services. For more information about our
  use of APIs and SDKs, please contact us as set forth in "[Contact
  Us](#contact-us)" below.

B.  **Disclosures to Protect Us or Others**

We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store
associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe
doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or
national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or
subpoena; protect your, our, or others' rights, property, or safety;
enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist
with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal
activity.

C.  **Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset
    Transfers**

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence,
reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or
transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold
or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or
contract.

personal information are determined by applicable law and are described

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us as
set forth in "[Contact Us](#contact-us)" below. We will
process such requests in accordance with applicable laws.

## SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

We take steps designed to ensure that your information is treated
securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no
system is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of
any information you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized disclosure.

By using our Services or providing personal information to us, you agree
that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security,
privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of our Services.
If we learn of a security system's breach, we may attempt to notify you
electronically by posting a notice on our Services, by mail or by
sending an email to you.

## INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and
stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United
States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are
different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your
information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.

If we transfer personal information which originates in the European
Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that
has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under
applicable data protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to
support such transfer is the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.

## RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

We store the personal information we collect as described in this
Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to
fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services,
resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue
legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with
applicable laws.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information,
we may consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and
sensitivity of the personal information, certain risk factors, the
purposes for which we process your personal information, and whether we
can achieve those purposes through other means.

## SUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

This Supplemental Notice for California Residents only applies to our
processing of personal information that is subject to the California
Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("**CCPA**"). Mysten Labs does not believe
it is subject to the CCPA. That said, Mysten Labs provides this
supplemental notice for purposes of transparency. The CCPA provides
California residents with the right to know what categories of personal
information Mysten Labs has collected about them and whether Mysten Labs
disclosed that personal information for a business purpose (e.g., to a

information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email
address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The
referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your
referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow
our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your
data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the
value of the referred party's data to us depends on whether the referred
party ultimately becomes a user and uses our Services. Said value will
be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program.
