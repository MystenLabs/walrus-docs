# Interacting with Walrus

We provide 3 ways to interact directly with the Walrus storage system:

- Through the Walrus [client command line interface (CLI)](./client-cli.md).
- Through a [JSON API](./json-api.md) of the Walrus CLI.
- Through an [HTTP API](./web-api.md) exposed by a public or local Walrus client daemon.
