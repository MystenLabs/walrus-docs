# Examples

As inspiration, we provide several simple examples in different programming languages to interact
with Walrus through the various interfaces. They are located at
<https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/tree/main/examples>.

## Python

The [Python examples](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/tree/main/examples/python) folder
contains a number of examples:

- How to [use the HTTP
  API](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/blob/main/examples/python/hello_walrus_webapi.py)
  to store and read a blob.
- How to [use the JSON
  API](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/blob/main/examples/python/hello_walrus_jsonapi.py)
  to store, read, and check the availability of a blob. Checking the certification of a blob
  illustrates reading the Blob Sui object that certifies (see the [Walrus Sui
  reference](../dev-guide/sui-struct.md)).
- How to [read information from the Walrus system
  object](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/blob/main/examples/python/hello_walrus_sui_system.py).
- How to [track Walrus related
  Events](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/blob/main/examples/python/track_walrus_events.py).

## JavaScript

A [JavaScript example](https://github.com/MystenLabs/walrus-docs/tree/main/examples/javascript) is
provided showing how to upload and download a blob through a web form using the HTTP API.
