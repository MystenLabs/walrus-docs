# Software development kits (SDKs) and other tools

The Walrus core team is actively working on a Rust SDK and a TypeScript SDK for Walrus. These will
cover interactions with storage nodes directly and be released around the time of the Mainnet
launch.

Besides these upcoming official SDKs, there also exist unofficial third-party SDKs for interacting
with the [HTTP API](./web-api.md#http-api-usage) exposed by Walrus aggregators and publishers:

- [Walrus Go SDK](https://github.com/namihq/walrus-go) (maintained by the *Nami Cloud* team)

Finally, there is [Tusky](https://docs.tusky.io/about/about-tusky), a complete data storage platform
built on Walrus, including encryption, HTTP APIs, sharing capabilities, and more.
