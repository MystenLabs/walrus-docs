# Using the Walrus client

The `walrus` binary can be used to interact with Walrus as a client. See the [setup
chapter](./setup.md) for prerequisites, installation, and configuration.

Detailed usage information is available through

```sh
walrus --help
```

Each sub-command of `walrus` can also be called with `--help` to print its specific arguments and
their meaning.

## Walrus system information

Information about the Walrus system is available through the `walrus info` command. For example,

```console
$ walrus info

Walrus system information
Current epoch: 0

Storage nodes
Number of nodes: 10
Number of shards: 1000

Blob size
Maximum blob size: 13.3 GiB (14,273,391,930 B)
Storage unit: 1.00 KiB

Approximate storage prices per epoch
Price per encoded storage unit: 50 MIST
Price to store metadata: 0.0031 SUI
Marginal price per additional 1 MiB (w/o metadata): 241,950 MIST

Total price for example blob sizes
16.0 MiB unencoded (135 MiB encoded): 0.0069 SUI per epoch
512 MiB unencoded (2.33 GiB encoded): 0.122 SUI per epoch
13.3 GiB unencoded (60.5 GiB encoded): 3.174 SUI per epoch
```

gives an overview of the number of storage nodes and shards in the system, the maximum blob size,
and the current cost in (Testnet) SUI for storing blobs.

Additional information such as encoding parameters and sizes, BFT system information, and
information on the storage nodes and their shard distribution can be viewed with the `--dev`
argument: `walrus info --dev`.

## Storing, querying status, and reading blobs

Storing blobs on Walrus can be achieved through the following command:

```sh
walrus store <some file>
```

The store command takes a CLI argument `--epochs <EPOCHS>` (or `-e`) indicating the number of
epochs the blob should be stored for. This defaults to 1 epoch, namely the current one.

If the blob is already stored on Walrus for a sufficient number of epochs the command does not store
it again. However, this behavior can be overwritten with the `--force` (or `-f`) CLI option, which
stores the blob again and creates a fresh blob object on Sui belonging to the wallet address.

The status of a blob can be queried through one of the following commands:

```sh
walrus blob-status --blob-id <BLOB_ID>
walrus blob-status --file <FILE>
```

This returns whether the blob is stored and its availability period. If you specify a file with the
`--file` option,the CLI re-encodes the content of the file and derives the blob ID before checking
the status.

When the blob is available, the `blob-status` command also returns the `BlobCertified` Sui event ID,
which consists of a transaction ID and a sequence number in the events emitted by the transaction.
The existence of this event certifies the availability of the blob.

Reading blobs from Walrus can be achieved through the following command:

```sh
walrus read <some blob ID>
```

By default the blob data is written to the standard output. The `--out <OUT>` CLI option (or `-o`)
can be used to specify an output file name. The `--rpc-url <URL>` (or `-r`) may be used to specify
a Sui RPC node to use instead of the one set in the wallet configuration or the default one.

## Changing the default configuration

Use the `--config` option to specify a custom path to the
[configuration location](../usage/setup.md#configuration).

The `--wallet <WALLET>` argument may be used to specify a non-standard Sui wallet configuration
file. And a `--gas-budget <GAS_BUDGET>` argument may be used to change the maximum amount of Sui (in
MIST) that the command is allowed to use.

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error like "the specified Walrus system object does not exist", make sure your wallet
is set up for Sui **Testnet** and you use the latest [configuration](./setup.md#configuration).
