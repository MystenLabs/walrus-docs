# Setup

At this stage of the project, our Walrus code is not yet public. Instead, we provide a pre-compiled
`walrus` client binary for macOS (Intel and Apple CPUs) and Ubuntu, which supports different usage
patterns (see [the next chapter](./interacting.md)). This chapter describes the
[prerequisites](./prerequisites.md), [installation](./installation.md), and
[configuration](./configuration.md) of the Walrus client.

Note that our Walrus devnet uses Sui **testnet** for coordination.
