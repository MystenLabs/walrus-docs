# Walrus Glossary

To make communication as clear and efficient as possible, we make sure to use a single term for
every Walrus entity/concept and *do not* use any synonyms. The following table lists various
concepts, their canonical name, and how they relate to or differ from other terms.

Italicized terms in the description indicate other specific Walrus terms contained in the table.

| Approved name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| permanent blob                    | blob which cannot be deleted by its owner and is guaranteed to be available until at least its expiry epoch (assuming it is valid)                                                          |
| deletable blob                    | blob which can be deleted by its owner at any time to be able to reuse the storage resource                                                                                                 |
| shard                             | (disjoint) subset of erasure-encoded data of all *blobs*; at every point in time, a *shard* is assigned to and stored on a single *SN*                                                      |
| RedStuff                          | our erasure-encoding approach, which uses two different encodings (*primary* and *secondary*) to enable shard recovery; details are available in the [whitepaper](./walrus.pdf)             |
| sliver                            | erasure-encoded data of one *shard* corresponding to a single blob for one of the two encodings; this contains several erasure-encoded symbols of that blob but not the *blob metadata*     |

| blob metadata                     | metadata of one *blob*; in particular, this contains a hash per *shard* to enable the authentication of *slivers* and recovery symbols                                                      |
| (end) user                        | any entity/person that wants to store or read *blobs* on/from Walrus; can act as a Walrus client itself or use the simple interface exposed by *publishers* and *caches*                    |
| publisher                         | service interacting with Sui and the *SNs* to store *blobs* on Walrus; offers a simple `HTTP POST` endpoint to *end users*                                                                  |

| (Walrus) client                   | entity interacting directly with the *SNs*; this can be an *aggregator*/*cache*, a *publisher*, or an *end user*                                                                            |
