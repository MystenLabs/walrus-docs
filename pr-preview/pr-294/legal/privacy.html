</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-disclose-your-information"><a class="header" href="#how-we-disclose-your-information">HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION</a></h2>
<p>We disclose your information to third parties for a variety of business
purposes, including to provide our Services, to protect us or others, or
in the event of a major business transaction such as a merger, sale, or
asset transfer, as described below.</p>
<p>A.  <strong>Disclosures to Provide our Services</strong></p>
<p>The categories of third parties with whom we may share your information
are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notice Regarding Use of Blockchain.</strong> Transactions on the Services
will be conducted via Blockchain. Information about your transfers
will be provided to a Blockchain and may be accessible to third
parties due to the public nature of the Blockchain. Because entries
to a Blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be
possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous,
public wallet address using external sources of information, any
transaction you enter onto the Blockchain could possibly be used to
identify you, or information about you.</li>
<li><strong>Other Users of the Services and Parties You Transact With.</strong> Some
of your personal information may be visible to other users of the
Services (e.g., information featured on generally accessible parts
of your profile; usernames of other Mysten Labs Services users). In
addition, to complete transfers via the Services, we will need to
share some of your personal information with the party that you are
transacting with.</li>
<li><strong>Third Party Websites and Applications.</strong> You may choose to share
personal information or interact with third-party websites and/or
third-party applications, including, but not limited to, third-party
electronic wallet extensions. Once your personal information has
been shared with a third-party website or a third-party application,
it will also be subject to such third party's privacy policy. We
encourage you to closely read each third-party website or
third-party application privacy policy before sharing your personal
information or otherwise interacting with them. Please note that we
do not control, and we are not responsible for the third-party
website's or the third-party application's processing of your
personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We may share your personal information with
our third-party service providers who use that information to help
us provide our Services. This includes service providers that
provide us with IT support, hosting, customer service, and related
services.</li>
<li><strong>Business Partners</strong>. We may share your personal information with
business partners to provide you with a product or service you have
requested. We may also share your personal information to business
partners with whom we jointly offer products or services.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliates</strong>. We may share your personal information with members
of our corporate family.</li>
<li><strong>Other Users/Website Visitors</strong>. As described above in "<a href="#personal-information-we-collect">Personal
Information We
Collect</a>," our
Services allow you to share your profile and/or User Content with
other users or publicly, including to those who do not use our
Services.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising Partners</strong>. We may share your personal information
with third-party advertising partners. These third-party advertising
partners may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our
Services to collect information regarding your activities and your
device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited,
location, time of day). These advertising partners may use this
information (and similar information collected from other services)
for purposes of delivering personalized advertisements to you when
you visit digital properties within their networks. This practice is
commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or
"personalized advertising."</li>
<li><strong>APIs/SDKs</strong>. We may use third-party application program interfaces
("<strong>APIs</strong>") and software development kits ("<strong>SDKs</strong>") as part of
the functionality of our Services. For more information about our
use of APIs and SDKs, please contact us as set forth in "<a href="#contact-us">Contact
Us</a>" below.</li>
</ul>
<p>B.  <strong>Disclosures to Protect Us or Others</strong></p>
<p>We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store
associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe
doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or
national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or
subpoena; protect your, our, or others' rights, property, or safety;
enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist
with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal
activity.</p>
<p>C.  <strong>Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset
Transfers</strong></p>
<p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence,
reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or
transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold
or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or
contract.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information,

purposes for which we process your personal information, and whether we
can achieve those purposes through other means.</p>

<p>The categories of sources from which we collect personal information and
our business and commercial purposes for using personal information are
set forth in "<a href="#personal-information-we-collect">Personal Information we
Collect</a>" and "<a href="#how-we-use-your-information">How We
Use of Your Information</a>" above,
respectively.</p>
<p><strong>"Sales" of Personal Information under the CCPA.</strong> For purposes of the
CCPA, Mysten Labs does not "sell" personal information, nor do we have
actual knowledge of any "sale" of personal information of minors under
16 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Privacy Rights for California Residents</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Discrimination.</strong> California residents have the right not to
receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of their rights
conferred by the CCPA.</p>
<p><strong>Authorized Agent.</strong> Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on
your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your
personal information. To designate an authorized agent, please contact
us as set forth in "<a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>" below and
provide written authorization signed by you and your designated agent.</p>
<p><strong>Verification</strong>. To protect your privacy, we will take the following
steps to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. When you
make a request, we will ask you to provide sufficient information that
allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
collected personal information or an authorized representative, which
may include confirming the email address associated with any personal
information we have about you. If you are a California resident and
would like to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, please contact
us as set forth in "<a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>" below. We
will process such requests in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
<p>**Refer-a-Friend and Similar In
"<a href="#how-we-use-your-information">How We Use Your Personal
Information</a> we may offer referral
programs or other incentivized data collection programs. For example, we
may offer incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or
credit in connection with these programs, wherein you provide your
personal information in exchange for a reward, or provide personal
information regarding your friends or colleagues (such as their email
address) and receive rewards when they sign up to use our Services. (The
referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your
referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow
our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your
data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the
value of the referred party's data to us depends on whether the referred
party ultimately becomes a user and uses our Services. Said value will
be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong>. This Privacy Policy uses industry-standard
technologies and was developed in line with the World Wide Web
Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1. If you
wish to print this policy, please do so from your web browser or by
saving the page as a PDF.</p>
<p><strong>California Shine the Light</strong>. The California "Shine the Light" law
permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us
once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have
disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing
purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal
information disclosed to those parties.</p>
<p><strong>Right for minors to remove posted content.</strong> Where required by law,
California residents under the age of 18 may request to have their
posted content or information removed from the publicly viewable
portions of the Services by contacting us directly as set forth in
"<a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>" below.</p>

information from children. If you learn that your child has provided us

set forth in "<a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>" below. If we
learn that we have collected a child's personal information in violation
of applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such
information.</p>
