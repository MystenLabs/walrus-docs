# The Walrus decentralized blob storage system

Welcome to the GitHub repository for Walrus, a decentralized storage and availability protocol
designed specifically for large binary files, or "blobs". Walrus focuses on providing a robust
solution for storing unstructured content on decentralized storage nodes while ensuring high
availability and reliability even in the presence of Byzantine faults.

## Documentation

Our documentation is available [as a Walrus Site](https://docs.walrus.site) (see [the
documentation](https://docs.walrus.site/walrus-sites/intro.html) for further information on what
this means) and on [GitHub Pages](https://mystenlabs.github.io/walrus-docs); it is generated using
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) from source files in the [`docs/`](./docs/) directory.

You can also build and access the documentation locally (assuming you have Rust installed):

```sh
cargo install mdbook
cargo install mdbook-admonish@1.18.0 --locked
cargo install mdbook-katex@0.9.0 --locked
cargo install mdbook-i18n-helpers --locked
mdbook serve
```

### Using translated version

If there is a translated resource in `po/` directory, it can be specified through `MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE` like below:

```bash
MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=zh_CN mdbook build
MDBOOK_BOOK__LANGUAGE=zh_CN mdbook serve
```
