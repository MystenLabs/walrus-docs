"**Storage and retrieval:** Walrus supports storage operations to write and "

msgstr ""

#: docs/index.md:44
msgid ""
"**Cost efficiency:** By utilizing advanced erasure coding, Walrus maintains "
"storage costs at approximately five times the size of the stored blobs, and "

"significantly more cost-effective than traditional full-replication methods "
"and much more robust against failures than protocols that only store each "
"blob on a subset of storage nodes."
msgstr ""

#: docs/index.md:50

"**Integration with the Sui blockchain:** Walrus leverages "
"[Sui](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui) for coordination, attesting "
"availability, and payments. Storage space is represented as a resource on "
"Sui, which can be owned, split, merged, and transferred. Stored blobs are "
"also represented by objects on Sui, which means that smart contracts can "
"check whether a blob is available and for how long, extend its lifetime or "
"optionally delete it."

msgid ""
"**Epochs, tokenomics, and delegated proof of stake** Walrus is operated by a "
"committee of storage nodes that evolve between epochs. A native token, WAL "
"(and its subdivision FROST, where 1 WAL is equal to 1 billion FROST), is "
"used to delegate stake to storage nodes, and those with high stake become "
"part of the epoch committee. The WAL token is also used for payments for "
"storage. At the end of each epoch, rewards for selecting storage nodes, "
"storing and serving blobs are distributed to storage nodes and whose that "
"stake with them. All these processes are mediated by smart contracts on the "
"Sui platform."
msgstr ""

#: docs/index.md:64
msgid ""
"**Flexible access:** Users can interact with Walrus through a command-line "
"interface (CLI), software development kits (SDKs), and web2 HTTP "
"technologies. Walrus is designed to work well with traditional caches and "
"content distribution networks (CDNs), while ensuring all operations can also "

"a dynamically changing set of storage nodes. The core of Walrus remains "

"Walrus provides two key benefits:"
msgstr ""

#: docs/blog/01_announcing_walrus.md:32
msgid ""
"**Cost-Effective Blob Storage:** Walrus allows for the uploading of "
"gigabytes of data at a time with minimal cost, making it an ideal solution "
"for storing large volumes of data. Walrus can do this because the data blob "
"is transmitted only once over the network, and storage nodes only spend a "
"fraction of resources compared to the blob size. As a result, the more "
"storage nodes the system has, the fewer resources each storage node uses per "
"blob."
msgstr ""

#: docs/blog/01_announcing_walrus.md:38
msgid ""
"**High Availability and Robustness:** Data stored on Walrus enjoys enhanced "
"reliability and availability under fault conditions. Data recovery is still "
"possible even if two-thirds of the storage nodes crash or come under "
"adversarial control. Further, availability may be certified efficiently "
"without downloading the full blob."
msgstr ""

#: docs/blog/01_announcing_walrus.md:43
msgid ""
"Decentralized storage can take multiple forms in modern ecosystems. For "
"instance, it offers better guarantees for digital assets traded as NFTs. "
"Unlike current designs that store data off-chain, decentralized storage "
"ensures users own the actual resource, not just metadata, mitigating risks "
"of data being taken down or misrepresented."
msgstr ""

#: docs/blog/01_announcing_walrus.md:48
msgid ""
"Additionally, decentralized storage is not only useful for storing data such "
"as pictures or files with high availability; it can also double as a "
"low-cost data availability layer for rollups. Here, sequencers can upload "
"transactions on Walrus, and the rollup executor only needs to temporarily "
"reconstruct them for execution."
msgstr ""

#: docs/blog/01_announcing_walrus.md:53
msgid ""
"We also believe Walrus will accompany existing disaster recovery strategies "
"for millions of enterprise companies. Not only is Walrus low-cost, it also "
"provides unmatched layers of data availability, integrity, transparency, and "
"resilience that centralized solutions by design cannot offer."
msgstr ""

#: docs/blog/01_announcing_walrus.md:58
msgid ""
"Walrus is powered by the Sui Network and scales horizontally to hundreds or "
"thousands of networked decentralized storage nodes. This should enable "
"Walrus to offer Exabytes of storage at costs competitive with current "
"centralized offerings, given the higher assurance and decentralization."
